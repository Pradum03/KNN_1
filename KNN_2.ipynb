    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they calculate the distance between two points in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is the straight line distance between two points in a feature space. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding elements of the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan distance is the distance between two points measured along the axes at right angles. It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. Euclidean distance is sensitive to the magnitude of the variables, while Manhattan distance is not. Therefore, if the variables in the dataset have different scales, the Euclidean distance may give more weight to variables with larger magnitudes, which may not be desirable. On the other hand, Manhattan distance is insensitive to the magnitude of the variables, but it may not capture the complex relationships between variables as well as the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the choice of distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. It is a good practice to try both Euclidean and Manhattan distances and compare their performance using cross-validation or other methods."

    "For example, the Euclidean distance metric is sensitive to the scale of the data, while the Manhattan distance metric is less sensitive to scale and may be more appropriate for datasets with features that have different units of measurement. The Minkowski distance metric can be used to balance the sensitivity to scale and outliers between the Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics.\n",

The hyperparameters that result in the best performance can then be selected for use with the final test set. Another approach is to use a grid search or random search over the hyperparameters to find the best combination."
